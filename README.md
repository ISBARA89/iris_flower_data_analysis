# Iris Flower Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of the Iris Flower Dataset, a famous dataset in pattern recognition. The project explores basic data analysis techniques including data visualization, summarizing trends, and understanding differences among various species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset Description
The Iris Flower Dataset contains data on 150 iris flowers, divided into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to install Python and several Python libraries. You can install the required dependencies with the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

## Analysis Steps
1. Load the Dataset: Load the Iris dataset using Pandas.
2. Explore the Data: Display the first few rows, check data types, and get summary statistics.
3. Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates (if any) and handle missing values (if any).
4. Data Analysis: Perform basic data analysis tasks like grouping, filtering, and sorting the data.
5. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
6. Conclusion: Summarize the insights obtained from the analysis.
