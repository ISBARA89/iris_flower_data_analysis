# Iris Flower Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of the Iris Flower Dataset, a famous dataset in pattern recognition. The project explores basic data analysis techniques including data visualization, summarizing trends, and understanding differences among various species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset Description
The Iris Flower Dataset contains data on 150 iris flowers, divided into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to install Python and several Python libraries. You can install the required dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
